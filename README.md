The Music Catalog Management System, or MCMS, will be written using Java; it will retrieve a 
collection of songs from a text file provided by the user, the user will be able to add new songs 
(from a text file, the data must be comma-delimited) to the Music Catalog, remove a song from 
the Catalog by providing the song’s ID or name. The user will also be able to display every song 
in their personal catalog and relevant information about the songs in the catalog including the 
song’s ID, name, album name, artist name, genre, the user’s personal rating of that song, and a
constantly updating ranking system based on the user’s rating of every song on the list. The user 
will also be able to sort the display to display only songs by a particular artist or within a 
particular album. Of course, the user will also be able to update their personal rating of a 
particular song. Potential users for this particular management system could be music critics, 
bloggers, connoisseurs, and hobbyists who want the ability to organize a collection of songs that 
they have listened to and rate those songs on a scale of 0.00-5.00.


This is the Music Catalog Management System, its intended uses include:
adding songs to a catalog with plenty of validation, removing a song from the catalog based on either song ID or title, displaying all songs in the
catalog in descending order by their rank, updating the user score of a song in the catalog which in turn effects a song's rank, and filtering the display of
all songs in the catalog by either album or author name. However, this is not all there is to
it because along with the functionalities of the project come the required constraints of these
functionalities, which would include making sure that there are no duplicate IDs,
preventing personal scores from going above or below the range of 0.00–5.00,
preventing song title and album names from being larger than 75 characters
preventing song aritst and genre names from being larger than 50 character,
that each attribute of the song objects in the catalog possesses the correct data types, that the program correctly
displays and ranks each song on the list based on each song's individual score, and,
making sure that the program accepts only comma-delimited test files that possess only six attributes when adding songs. All of which the user interacts with
at some point via the menu.
